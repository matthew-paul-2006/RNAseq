# RNAseq #
A collection of analyses of S. cerevisiae RNAseq data

## tRNA expression ##
An Rscript analysis of tRNA expression in S. cerevisiae, compared to spike-in control S. pombe. Read in featurecounts data files of each dataset following spike-in pipeline analysis. RNA seq data was produced with polyA depletion so should not select for tRNAs unless they are being degraded. It may give insight, however, into their transcripiton. 

## spike-in RNA mapping ##
A slurm script that
